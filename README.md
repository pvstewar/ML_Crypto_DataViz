# ML_Crypto_DataViz
## Using Data Visualization to Examine ML and Graph Cryptocurrency Illicit Transaction Datasets

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a variety of python data visualization techniques. Given the key role of cryptocurrency in monetizing cybersecurity vulnerability exploitation, I was interested in understanding the methods used in tracking illicit transactions in some of the most common cryptocurrency types. I was able to find a couple quality machine learning and advanced analytics studies that actually make their training data publicly available and I was able to visualize and gain a better understanding of the data and the patterns that the advanced analytical systems are uncovering within it. These methods can be of great use to help counter the perception that machine learning decisions can't be understood by allowing anyone to visualize the patterns and draw conclusions about how decisions are made. The exploration of these datasets also helped to understand the scale and composition of the use of cryptocurrncy in a variety of illicit financial activities.
